# Full-Stack Curriculum

## Proposal

Before you can start working on your full-stack project you need to pick
an app to build. You will start by submitting a list of three possible
apps you would be interested in creating. This is your _tentative
proposal_. You will assigned one of them.

Before you start on your full-stack project you will create a detailed
proposal in which you carefully plan out the app you are going to build.
