# Exceptions & Error Handling  

Estimated time: 15min.

## Learning Goals

* Know how to raise and rescue an exception
* Be able to explain how an exception bubbles up after it is raised
* Know when to use `ensure` and `retry`
* Be able to choose an appropriate exception class

## Memory 2 Memory Puzzle

Go back to our [Memory solutions][memory-solutions] from w1d2 and harden the code, looking for places where we could throw exceptions, or rescue them, rather than using plain loops.
