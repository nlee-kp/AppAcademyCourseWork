# Peer Reviews
**W9D2**

For peer reviews, you and a classmate will evaluate each other's apps.
You will be grading their app using the same spreadsheet that the Placements 
team will eventually use to grade your full stack project. It is a great 
opportunity to get a fresh set of eyes on your project and see how a user 
interacts with your site!

## Structure

You will be assigned two different fellow students to pair with. You will meet with
each for 30 min. Follow the below framework for each pairing:
  * Share your reviewer on your google doc [grading spreadsheet][peer-review-form]
  * First 15 min: review each other site's and fill out the spreadsheet
  * Second 15 min: discuss with each other the experience using each site and
  provide constructive feedback. Provide explanations for the scores you gave.
