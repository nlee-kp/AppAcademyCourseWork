# Using Trello

## Overview

During Full Stack Projects the teaching staff will use [Trello][trello] to manage your
project. An instructor will be assigned as your 'project manager'. It shall
be their duty to ensure that you are progressing through your project.

Trello will be used to assign you tasks as well as indicate when you have
finished any of your MVP features.

## Getting Things Set Up

Head to [Trello][trello] and set up an account if you don't already have one,
it's free! Make a new board for your project and give it the same name.

Make 5 lists:

0. Incomplete MVP Features
0. MVP Features to Review
0. Complete MVP Features
0. Issues
0. Completed Issues

Populate the 'Incomplete MVP Features' list with cards for all 7 of your
[MVP Features][mvp]. With the exception of the production readme and hosting on
heroku, each feature should also have a checklist with the following items:

* Adequate styling
* Smooth, bug-free navigation
* Adequate and appropriate seeds to demonstrate the feature

Add your project manager to your board so they can access it.

When you are finished, you should have something [like this][sample].

## Working with your Project Manager

The goal is to complete all 7 key MVP features and ideally finish some bonus
features as well.

All of your features begin in the Incomplete list. When you have made progress
and think a feature is done, drag the card from the Incomplete list to the
'MVP Features to Review' list. Then, your project manager will review that
feature in your next scheduled review. They will either decide that it is indeed
complete to satisfaction (and mark all three checklist items complete), or
drag it back to incomplete. If the feature was deemed incomplete, the project
manager should create 'issues' and add cards to the 'Issues' list.

When you fix the issues created by your project manager, you shall once again
drag the feature you were working on back to the review list. When your project
manager returns they will once again check the feature out and in turn drag it
to 'Complete MVP Features'.

We require you to have these 5 lists minimally, but we encourage you to make
your own lists to help yourself stay organized with what you are working on.
If making even more lists to keep track of what is in progress or what needs
a specific kind of help would be useful to you, go right ahead!
